The editor comes with default labels in english, but all are overridable.

- For blocks, styles, and entities, use the `label` and-or `description` prop to set text in the right language.
- For boolean controls (`enableLineBreak`, etc), set instead an object with `icon`, `label`, `description` props (all optional).

Depending on the target language, you may also need to use the `textDirectionality` prop (`LTR` or `RTL`). See the full [Draft.js documentation](https://draftjs.org/docs/api-reference-editor.html#textdirectionality) for more details.

## Example

This example is built with [react-intl](https://github.com/yahoo/react-intl), but the editor integration is completely agnostic of what solution you use.
